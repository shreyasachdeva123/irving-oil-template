# Irving Oil homepage

Submission of my completed assignment for the Irving Oil homepage.

* The site is based on React.js and is mobile responsive.
* On the smaller screen, hamburger menu to showcase the navbar.  

* Carousel is interactive. Left/right arrow buttons scrolls and loops through the images

* The cards change positioning on smaller screen. They are stacked on each other and displayed in a column for better readability.

* The code is divided into smaller and isolated react components for easier maintainability.
